# CS546_WP_Group_13_Final_Project

Project Description

We are creating a website application where a dog owner can hire a nanny or sitter for a predetermined period of time to take care of their dogs. The motivation behind this project is if a dog owner needs to visit outside town for few hours or days, then by hiring a sitter for their dogs will relieve owners of mental stress about their dogs that stay back home. In this application, we will include features that will manage both dog owner’s and sitter’s profile. Both dog owner and sitter will be able to navigate through the web application where they can create, update or delete their information accordingly. As admins, we will have access to both dog owner and sitter databases and monitor their activities for record. 

In this web application dog owner can provide his/her experience by reviewing and rating the sitter after their service and the other way round where sitters can review dog owners to maintain conduct between both parties involved. The ratings will range from 0-5. Also, sitter will be asked to include price range in their profile. The basic or minimum price range a sitter will charge is $20 per hour depending on the type of service booked. Based on their reviews, ratings and price range Dog Owner will hire a sitter for their dogs. The core features of our website application are mentioned below in detail along with extra features. 

This is a useful and friendly website for dog owners and dog sitter!
